# Interactive-Black-Jack-game-

In this project, a client or user plays the traditional Black-Jack game with AI. 
Once, the user starts the application, he/she will be welcomed by a welcome screen which prompts the user to enter the name and number of games he wish to play.
Then the user has to select the amount to bet for that game.
Once the user is welcomed, the dealer deals the cards to the user and the AI.
User is provided with the options to hit or stand based on his moves.
After calculating the winner, the customized message will be shown to the user on the winner screen.

Hope you all like this application.
Any suggestions for the updation are warmly welcomed.
